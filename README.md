Creates virtual machines for Linux Network Servers exams

# Requirements
This script needs a quite recent version of the libguestfs package. The packages found in the Ubuntu 14.04 are too old; this was tested succesfully in Arch Linux and Fedora Server 21. The script uses virt-install and virt-customize.
It also requires Python 3 and the libvirt Python3 bindings. It might work in Python 2, but it has not been tested.
